Many simple encoding techniques has been devised over a period of time. A common method having to do with the computer is the ASCII character set used to display characters on the screen. Each character is been given a numeric value which can be interpreted by the computer.

In this challenge, you will be given a string to decode. An example of the encoded string follows. The table shows the conversion from the string PrepInsta to the ASCII string 801141011127311011511697;

Character	P	r	e	p	I	n	s	t	a
ASCII value	80	114	101	112	73	110	115	116	97
We then reverse the ASCII string to get the encoded string 796115110113721110141108

To decode the string first reverse the string of digits, then successfully pick valid values from the string and convert them to their ASCII equivalents. Some of the values will have two digits, and others three. Use the range of valid values while decoding the string of digits.

For reference, the character in s correspond to the following ASCII values

The value range from A to Z is 65 to 90
The value range from a to z is 97 to 122
The value of space character is 32
Function Description

Write a function decode. The function must return the original decoded string.

decode() has the following parameters:

encoded: an encoded string
Constraints

1 <= |s| <= 105
s[i] âˆˆ {ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz}
Sample Input 0

23511011501782351112179911801562340161171141148

Sample Output 0

Truth always wins

Explanation 0

We reverse encoded to get 8411411711610432651081197121115328710511011532. We then replace each ASCII Value with its corresponding character:


Code:
num = input()
num = num[::-1]
Final_string = ''
number = ''
for i in range(len(num)):
    number = number + num[i]
    if (int(number) >= 65 and int(number) <= 90) or (int(number) >= 97 and int(number) <= 122) or (int(number) == 32):
        character = chr(int(number))
        Final_string+=character
        number = ''
print(Final_string)
 
 
Output:
23511011501782351112179911801562340161171141148
Truth Always Wins
